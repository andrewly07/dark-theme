            <p class="paragraph">
              Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means
              keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your
              home.
            </p>

            <p>
              To practice social or physical distancing: Stay at least 6 feet (2
              meters) from other people. Do not gather in groups. Stay out of
              crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
              <p> <b>Stay connected while staying away.</b> It is very important to stay in touch with friends and family that don’t live in your home. Call, video chat, or stay connected using social media. Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations and having to socially distance yourself from someone you love can be difficult.
            </p>

                Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community.
